Step 1: Defining the project

  1. What is the project?
    The project is a blog-webpage, it will be solved using HTML, CSS and JS. It will at first be to post about
    travelling, so our families can keep up with what we are doing. Our end goal however will be expending to a fully functional blog
    where anyone can see and engage in what we are doing, like reading, commenting, donating etc.


  2. What is the MVP (Minimal Viable Product)?
    The MVP would be a webpage where you can see what we're doing on our travelling, like reading our posts and seeing pictures.
    It will consist of:
      -Navigator (Home, About Us, Blog, Photos, Contact, donation?)
      -Pages for all the ones included in the Navigator
      -Input where users can sign up to follow (email)
      -Links to all social media
      -Latest blog posts
      -Archive (all posts)
      -Responsive for all devices



  3. What are the nice to haves?
    The nice to haves would be to have different tags on posts/pictures so you can search for specific things. Also having a log-in system
    so we can regulate who has access to what.
    -Login
    -search bar
    -animations
    -rotating pictures

  4. When will the project be complete?
    The project will  be complete when we've reached our goal of having a fully functional blog-webpage.
